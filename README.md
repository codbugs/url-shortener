# My Personal Url Shortener

A personal Url Shortener inspired by [Bit.ly] and [Twitter], [Facebook] and some other web applications and companies that provide this kind of service to the users to ease the use of long URLs.

## The real objective

This web application aims to show how easy is to shorten a URL provided by users and analyze the data provided each time any person clicks on the shortened URL. For example, you can analyze which URL is the most clicked by day, by hour, or by minute, you can get information about the browsers used when clicking the URLs, the IP addresses of each click, and the referrer of the application that hosts the shortened URL.

## Technical information

The Personal Url Shortener has been coded using [Next.js] framework that implies the use of JavaScript, [React], and [Node.js].

It has been developed in several [Twitch] sessions on my channel. Take a look and send me greetings if I'm in live session. Send me any comment and follow me if you like it and, if you think the content is amazing, send me a subscription.

I also have a [Youtube] channel where you can find all [Twitch] videos about the Personal Url Shortener and some other stuff. Send me any comment or subscribe if you like it.


## Going further

If you think you can contribute to improving the application by adding authentication, for instance, fork it, and let's make it bigger and better.
